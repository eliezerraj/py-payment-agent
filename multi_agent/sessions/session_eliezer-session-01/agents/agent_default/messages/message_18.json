The get_accounts_from_person(P-233) call confirmed ACC-233 is the only account associated with this person. Since the original query was non-specific, I've now gathered:\n\n1. Account ownership verification (P-233 owns ACC-233)\n2. Service health status (healthy in dev)\n3. Account creation timestamp (April 2025)\n\nTo provide comprehensive account processing:\n- Account statement retrieval would show financial activity\n- Memory graph storage would persist relationships\n\nHowever, since the user didn't specify financial details were needed and memory graph operations weren't requested, the most prudent next step is to report the collected information while confirming service health. The statement retrieval could be considered optional unless explicitly requested.</thinking>\n\nAccount ACC-233 status:\n- **Owner**: Person ID P-233\n- **Creation Date**: 2025-04-29\n- **Service Health**: Healthy (running in dev environment v3.3)\n- **Associated Accounts**: Only ACC-233 linked to P-233\n\nThe account service is operational with no detected issues. If you need financial statements or transaction history, please specify.\n"
