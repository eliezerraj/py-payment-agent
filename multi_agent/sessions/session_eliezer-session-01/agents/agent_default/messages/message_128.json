The first card (111.111.111.100) returned valid data, but the other two (111.111.111.101 and 111.111.111.102) encountered \"client session running\" errors. \n\nKey considerations:\n1. CARD service health check required before retrying\n2. Must verify service status per protocol\n3. Previous health checks showed HEALTHY but transient errors occurred\n\nNext step: Check CARD service health to determine if system issues exist before retrying failed requests.</thinking> "
