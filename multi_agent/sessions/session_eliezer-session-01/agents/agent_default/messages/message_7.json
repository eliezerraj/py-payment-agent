Previous attempt used parallel tool calls but user rephrased request\n3. Health checks don't require account numbers - system-level verification\n4. Must confirm both services are operational before reporting status\n\nSince health checks are system-wide and both agents need verification, I'll re-run the parallel health checks for both Account and Ledger services using their respective tools with \"health check\" queries.</thinking>\n\n"
