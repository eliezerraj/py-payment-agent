Previous attempts showed Ledger was healthy but Account requires authentication\n3. Health checks are system-wide operations\n4. Must report both statuses accurately while maintaining security\n\nSince:\n- Ledger Agent previously reported healthy\n- Account Agent requires authentication that hasn't been provided\n- Health checks need to be re-attempted for completeness\n\nWill execute parallel health checks again for both services. If Account Agent still fails authentication, will report known statuses while clarifying the authentication requirement.</thinking> "
