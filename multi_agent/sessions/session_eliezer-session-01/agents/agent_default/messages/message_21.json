Ledger Agent health check not requested\n3. Previous attempts showed Account Agent requires authentication\n4. Must follow protocol of reporting exact service name\n\nSince:\n- Only Account Agent health is requested\n- Authentication is required but hasn't been provided\n- Health checks need valid credentials\n\nWill attempt Account Agent health check again while clarifying the authentication requirement. Will not check Ledger Agent as per user instruction.</thinking> "
