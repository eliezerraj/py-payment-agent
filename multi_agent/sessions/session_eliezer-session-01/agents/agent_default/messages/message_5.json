Account Agent handles account information - health check required\n3. Ledger Agent handles financials - also needs health verification\n4. No specific account number provided, but health checks are system-wide\n\nSince health checks are required for both services, I'll need to:\n- Use account_agent with health check query\n- Use ledger_agent with health check query\n\nBoth tools accept \"health check\" as valid input according to their parameters. Will execute these in parallel since they're independent checks.</thinking>\n\n"
