The user's query cannot be processed further without a valid card. Next steps would require verifying the card ID with the user or checking related services, but based on current data, the card isn't found.</thinking> The CARD service is currently healthy, but the card ID 111111111100 was not found in the system. Please verify the card ID and try again. If you need further assistance, please provide additional details.\n"
