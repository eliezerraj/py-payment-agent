However, the initial get_card attempt failed with a 404 error, meaning the card ID 111111111100 doesn't exist in the system. Since the service is healthy, the error is due to an invalid card ID. The user's request to \"process the query\" likely requires valid card data, which we can't retrieve. At this point, we should inform the user that the card wasn't found and verify if they need help with another card ID or different operation.</thinking> I've checked the CARD service health and it's operational. However, the card ID 111111111100 couldn't be found (404 error). Please verify the card number or let me know if you need assistance with another query.\n"
