Card Agent's parameters require a \"query\" argument (e.g., specific card ID)\n3. There's no system-wide card health check endpoint\n4. Previous attempts showed no dedicated card service health monitoring\n\nSince:\n- Card health checks require a specific card ID\n- The user didn't provide a card identifier\n- Health status requires individual card verification\n\nWill need to:\n1. Ask user for specific card ID to check\n2. Explain that system-wide card health isn't available\n3. Clarify that card_agent requires card details for health checks</thinking>\n\nTo check card health status, I need a specific card ID (e.g., CARD-1234). The system doesn't support system-wide card health checks. Please provide the card number you want to verify, and I'll check its status using available tools.\n\nExample request: \"Check health status of card CARD-5678\""
