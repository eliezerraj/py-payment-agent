Previous attempts showed:\n   - Ledger Agent: Healthy\n   - Account Agent: Requires authentication\n3. Must report both statuses accurately\n\nSince:\n- Ledger Agent consistently reports healthy\n- Account Agent requires authentication not provided\n- Health checks need valid credentials for Account\n\nWill execute parallel health checks again for completeness. If Account Agent still requires authentication, will report known statuses while clarifying the requirement.</thinking> "
