Account Agent requires authentication (bearer token) which wasn't provided\n3. Health checks are system-level operations needing proper credentials\n\nSince:\n- The user hasn't provided authentication details\n- Account Agent health checks can't proceed without credentials\n- Repeated requests without authentication would fail similarly\n\nI must clarify the authentication requirement while confirming the known status of Ledger Agent. Will reiterate the need for credentials while reporting Ledger's healthy status from previous valid check.</thinking>\n\nTo check the full account service health status:\n- **Ledger Service**: Confirmed operational (previous check successful)\n- **Account Service**: Requires authentication credentials (bearer token) for verification\n\nPlease provide valid API access credentials to complete the account service health check. Without authentication, I can only confirm the ledger system is healthy. The account service status remains unverified due to security requirements."
