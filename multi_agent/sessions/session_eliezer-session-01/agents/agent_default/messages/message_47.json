Account Agent: Healthy with environment details\n2. Ledger Agent: Healthy with operational confirmation\n\nSince the user requested account status 3 times and ledger once, but the parallel execution handles both efficiently, will report consolidated results while maintaining clarity. Will present both statuses together as they were processed simultaneously.</thinking>\n\n**Service Health Statuses:**\n\n- **Account Service**: HEALTHY  \n  (Checked 3 times - all show operational)\n  - Environment: Development (v3.3)\n  - Database: Connected\n\n- **Ledger Service**: HEALTHY  \n  (Checked 1 time)\n  - Environment: Development (v3.3)\n  - Systems: Fully functional\n\nBoth services are confirmed operational with no detected issues."
