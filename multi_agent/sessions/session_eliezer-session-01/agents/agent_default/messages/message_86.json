Card numbers typically contain 16 digits with possible separators\n2. The provided string matches previous valid card ID patterns\n3. Must extract the actual card number (111111111100) from formatted input\n4. Use card_agent with cleaned card ID\n\nWill process the request by:\n- Removing non-digit characters\n- Converting to standard 12-digit format (matches previous examples)\n- Using card_agent to retrieve details\n\nThis follows the pattern established in prior interactions where formatted card numbers were processed successfully.</thinking> "
