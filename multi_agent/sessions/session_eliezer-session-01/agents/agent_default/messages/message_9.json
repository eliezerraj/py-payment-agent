Ledger Agent reported healthy status with operational confirmation\n3. Need to report both outcomes while maintaining security protocols\n\nSince health checks require authentication for Account Agent but Ledger Agent succeeded, I'll:\n- Inform user about Ledger's healthy status\n- Explain authentication requirement for Account Agent health check\n- Avoid exposing technical details about missing tokens\n- Maintain separation between service statuses</thinking>\n\n**Service Health Status Report:**\n- **Ledger Service**: Operational and healthy (all systems functioning normally)\n- **Account Service**: Health verification requires authentication. Please provide valid credentials to check this service's status.\n\nNote: The ledger system shows no issues, but account service health checks need authorized access for full verification."
