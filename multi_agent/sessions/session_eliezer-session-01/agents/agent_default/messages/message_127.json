The API returned valid data including masked card number, account association, and status. \n\nKey points to verify against CARD rules:\n1. Card number formatting: The response shows \"card_number\": \"111.111.111.100\" which matches the required format\n2. No raw digits exposed: All numeric values are either properly formatted or non-sensitive\n3. Required fields present: Account ID, card number, ATC, status, etc.\n\nSince the response contains all necessary information in compliant format, the final answer should present these details while maintaining formatting rules. The card number is already properly masked in the response, so no additional formatting needed.</thinking> Here are the card details:\n- **Card Number**: 111.111.111.100\n- **Account ID**: ACC-100\n- **Holder**: holder-100\n- **Type**: CREDIT\n- **Status**: ISSUED\n- **Expiry Date**: 2030-04-12\n- **ATC**: 5044\n\nThe card is currently active and properly linked to account ACC-100. Would you like to perform additional operations?\n"
