Available tools are account_agent, ledger_agent, card_agent, and calculator\n3. Card Agent requires a specific card ID for queries\n4. System doesn't support system-wide card health checks\n\nSince:\n- The user mentioned \"card_healthy\" which doesn't exist\n- Card Agent needs card ID parameters\n- Health status requires individual verification\n\nWill need to:\n1. Clarify that \"card_healthy\" tool doesn't exist\n2. Explain proper usage of card_agent with card ID\n3. Reiterate system limitations on service-wide checks</thinking>\n\nI can't execute \"card_healthy\" because it doesn't exist. To check card health:\n\n1. Use **card_agent** with a specific card ID (e.g., \"CARD-1234\")\n   - Example: `card_agent(query=\"CARD-5678\")`\n\n2. System limitations:\n   - No service-wide card health checks\n   - Requires individual card verification\n\nFor system-wide status, contact technical support. If you have a specific card ID, provide it for health verification."
